The Klarna Payments SDK is avaliable through Carthage and Cocoapods.

* Using Carthage, add this to your Cartfile:

    ```swift
    github "klarna/kp-mobile-sdk"
    ```

* Using Cocoapods, add this to your podspec:

    ```swift
    pod "KlarnaPayments"
    ```

* Alternatively you can add the framework manually.

* Import the framework and get started!

    ```swift
    import KlarnaPayments
    ```


## Integration Steps

The SDK allows merchants to integrate a native payments experience into their apps, and one way merchants may present Klarna Payments where the SDK manages the payment view which merchants embed into their apps UI layout and handle the initialization, loading, authorization, finalization, sizing and errors.

The merchants process to integrate the SDK into their app is these steps:

* To add the payments in your native flow, first create a credit session through Klarna's Payments API, you are then provided with a client token and one or more payment method categories. See https://developers.klarna.com/api/#payments-api-create-a-new-credit-session, the example app shows you how this can be done.

* Then initialize a `KlarnaPaymentView` using the client token and a payment method category identifier.

    ```swift
    paymentView = init(clientToken:, category:, returnUrl:, delegate:)
    ```

* Upon a successful initialization of your payment view, the following `KlarnaPaymentViewDelegate` `klarnaPaymentViewInitialized(paymentView:)` function is called.

* Once the payment view has been successful initialized, you can load it.

    ```swift
        paymentView.load()
    ```

* Once the payment view has been successful loaded, the following `KlarnaPaymentViewDelegate` `klarnaPaymentViewLoaded(paymentView)` function is called, followed by `klarnaPaymentView(paymentView:, resizedToHeight:)`.

* You can now call `paymentView.authorize(autoFinalize:, jsonData:)` to authorize the payment category. If you need to reauthorize call `paymentView.reauthorize(jsonData:)`.

* Once the payment view has been successful authorized or reauthorized, the following `KlarnaPaymentViewDelegate` `klarnaPaymentView(paymentView:, approved:, authorizedWithToken:, finalizeRequired:)` or `klarnaPaymentView(paymentView:, approved:, reauthorizedWithToken:)` function is called.

  * Your payment view is now ready to by finalized if finalization is required, call `paymentView.finalise()`. Please note that this function is called `finalise()` with *s*, and not `finalize()` with *z* which belongs to `NSObject`.

  * Once the payment view has been successful finalized, the following `KlarnaPaymentViewDelegate` `klarnaPaymentView(paymentView:, approved:, finalizedWithToken:)` function is called.

* You can now create a new order with the authorization token through Klarna's Payments API. See https://developers.klarna.com/api/#payments-api-create-a-new-order, the example app shows you how this can be done.

If a Klarna payment error occurred in any step. The `KlarnaPaymentViewDelegate` `klarnaPaymentView(paymentView:, failedWithError:)` function provides an error about what happened and whether itâ€™s recoverable.

You may add the payment view to your apps UI layout once it has been initialized or at a later point. The `KlarnaPaymentViewDelegate` provides several steps where you can find a suitable solution for your apps.

You are responsible for resizing the payment view.
